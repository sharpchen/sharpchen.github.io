# Singleton

## Concept

Generally, `Singleton` is the only instance exists during a `AppDomain` or a `Thread`.

## Basic Implementation

```csharp
class Singleton
{
    private static readonly Singleton _instance = new();
    public static Singleton Instance => _instance.Value;
    private Singleton() { }

    // ...elided
}
```

## Lazy Initialization

Lazy initialization ensures the instance won't be created until it were accessed, and `Lazy<T>` also ensures **thread safety**.
Pass a delegate to `Lazy<T>.Lazy(Func<T>)` to generate its value.

```csharp
class Singleton
{
    private static readonly Lazy<Singleton> _instance = new(() => new());
    public static Singleton Instance => _instance.Value;
    private Singleton() { }

    // ...elided
}
```

## `Singleton` is a **BAD** idea?

### Testablity issue

Singleton is hard to test, using Singleton of a type means hard coding it in your code base, not flexible enough.

- Use `interface` to abstract singleton usage to enhance your code.

### Dependency Injection

The best practice is using **Dependency Injection** to generate an singleton in runtime instead of coding on your own.
Each call to `container.Resolve<T>()` will return a shared instance of the specified type in the same thread. With this approach, we don't need to code our singleton on our own, but constructor of target type shall be `public`, or the **IOC** framework can not access it during the runtime.

- Following example uses `Autofac` to perform dependency injection.

```csharp
class OrdinaryClass
{
    public OrdinaryClass() { }
    // ...elided
}
public class DependencyInjectionTest
{
    [Fact]
    public void DependencyInjection()
    {
        ContainerBuilder builder = new();
        builder.RegisterType<OrdinaryClass>().SingleInstance();
        using var container = builder.Build();
        Assert.True(container.Resolve<OrdinaryClass>() is not null);
    }
}
```

## Mono-state Singleton

**Mono-state Singleton** allows you to access its constructor, but all state of this type are static, all instances shares the same states.
Not a good approach though.

```csharp
class MonoStateSingleton
{
    private static int _state01 = 0x0;
    private static int _state02 = 0x64;

    public int State01 { get => _state01; set => _state01 = value; }
    public int State02 { get => _state02; set => _state02 = value; }

    // ...elided
}
```

## Thread Singleton

Use `ThreadLocal<T>` to make object thread safe and static for each thread.
Each thread has a different singleton

```csharp
class ThreadSingleton
{
    private static readonly ThreadLocal<ThreadSingleton> _instance = new(() => new());
    private int _threadAccessedCount;
    public static ThreadSingleton Instance => _instance.Value!;
    public int ThreadAccessedCount => ++_threadAccessedCount;
    private ThreadSingleton() { }

    //...elided
}
```

## Ambient Context

**Ambient Context** is similar to singleton pattern, one of its advantage is, it allows you to change the static value/state of the type during the procedure. And in some cases we don't have to preserve a parameter position for a method that access the AmbientContext type.
When `IDisposable` is implemented by `AmbientContext`, `using` statement will auto invoke `Dispose()`, this can be used to restore the state depending on how you implement the `Dispose()` method.

```csharp
class AmbientContext : IDisposable
{
    private static int _currentState;
    public static int CurrentState { get => _currentState; private set => _currentState = value; }

    private static readonly ThreadLocal<AmbientContext> _context = new(() => new());
    public static AmbientContext CurrentContext { get => _context.Value!; set => _context.Value = value; }
    public AmbientContext(int state = 250) => _currentState = state;
    public void Dispose() => _currentState = 250;

    //...elided
}

public class AmbientContextTest
{
    [Fact]
    public void Test()
    {
        AmbientContext.CurrentContext = new AmbientContext();
        DoSomethingUsingAmbientContext();
        using (var context = new AmbientContext(500))
        {
            Assert.Equal(500, AmbientContext.CurrentState);
        }
        Assert.Equal(250, AmbientContext.CurrentState);

        static void DoSomethingUsingAmbientContext() =>
            Console.WriteLine($"state is {AmbientContext.CurrentState}");
    }
}
```
