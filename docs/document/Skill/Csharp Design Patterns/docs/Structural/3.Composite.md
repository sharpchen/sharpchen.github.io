# Composite

A mechanism for treating individual objects and certain compositions of objects in a uniform manner(same api).

## Motivation

1. Make compound objects.
2. Objects use other object's fields/properties/members through inheritance and composition.
3. Treat both single and composite objects uniformly.

## Geometric Shapes

To make single object and grouped objects having same behaviors, 
we set a collection of the same type(`List<Graphic> children`), and then apply recursive actions on them(`void Display()`). The side effect is that it may result in a reference loop, when displaying the group finally got a overflow. We shall have a reference checking before we add any child, but we are not going to talk about that.

```cs
class Graphic
{
    public Color Color { get; set; }
    public string Name => this.GetType().Name;
    protected readonly Lazy<List<Graphic>> children = new();
    public void AddChildren(params Graphic[] child) => child.ToList().ForEach(children.Value.Add);
    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Displaying {Name} object with color {Color.Name.ToLower()}");
        children.Value.ForEach(x => x?.Display());
    }
}
class Rectangle : Graphic { }
class Circle : Graphic { }

public class GroupingTest
{
    [Fact]
    public void Test()
    {
        Rectangle rectangle = new() { Color = Color.Aqua };
        Circle circle = new() { Color = Color.Orange };
        Graphic graphic = new() { Color = Color.White };
        Graphic graphicAnother = new() { Color = Color.Black };
        graphicAnother.AddChildren(circle, rectangle);
        graphic.AddChildren(rectangle, circle, graphicAnother);
        graphic.Display();
    }
}
```

## Neutral Networks

The key of `Composite` pattern is treating single object as a group. **Neuron** is the minimal unit of **Neural Network**, **Neural Layer** are made of several **Neurons**, **Neural Network** are made of **Neural Layers**. So when implementing `Composite` pattern, we treat them all as a collection(group), so we make `Neuron` as `IEnumerable<Neuron>`, `NeuronLayer` as `Collection<Neuron>`. So all of them are `IEnumerable<Neuron>`.
So now we can define some common functionalities using extension methods.

```cs
class Neuron : IEnumerable<Neuron>
{
    public required Half Value { get; set; }
    internal List<Neuron> In { get; } = new();
    internal List<Neuron> Out { get; } = new();

    public IEnumerator<Neuron> GetEnumerator()
    {
        yield return this;
    }
    public void ConnectTo(Neuron other)
    {
        other.In.Add(this);
        this.Out.Add(other);
    }
    IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator() => GetEnumerator();
}
class NeuralLayer : Collection<Neuron> { }
class NeuralNetwork : Collection<NeuralLayer> { }
```

We hope `Neuron`, `NeuralLayer`, `NeuralNetwork` have a same functionality like `void ConnectTo()` to connect whatever a `Neuron` to `NeuralLayer` or `NeuralNetwork`, and so forth.

So we make an extension method.

```cs
static class NeuronExtension
{
    public static void ConnectTo(this IEnumerable<Neuron> from, IEnumerable<Neuron> to)
    {
        foreach (var f in from)
            foreach (var t in to)
            {
                f.Out.Add(t);
                t.In.Add(f);
            }
    }
}
```

Now any neuron, any layer, any network can be connected to each other like there is no difference among them. This is the composite pattern.

```cs
Neuron neuron1 = new() { Value = (Half)1 };
Neuron neuron2 = new() { Value = (Half)2 };
NeuralLayer layer1 = new();
NeuralNetwork net = new();
neuron1.ConnectTo(neuron2);
neuron2.ConnectTo(layer1);
layer1.ConnectTo(net);
```
