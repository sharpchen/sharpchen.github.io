# Pointer operators

For all value and reference types, there's a pointer version of it(`T*`), **the pointer instance stores the address of the variable**.

|operator|name|usage|
|---|---|---|
|`&`|address-of operator|returns a pointer to the address of a variable|
|`*`|dereference operator|returns the variable at the address of a pointer, in other words, returns a pointer|
|`->`|pointer-to-member operator|syntactic sugar in which `x->y` is equivalent to `(*x).y`|
|`++`|pointer addition operator|adds `sizeof(T)` to the address contained in the variable|
|`--`|pointer subtraction operator|subtracts `sizeof(T)` to the address contained in the variable|
|`[]`|pointer element accessor|retrieve value of address with an offset, in which `p[i]` is equivalent to `*(p + i)`|

## Pointer Increment and Decrement

If a pointer increment or decrement operation overflows the domain of the pointer type, the result is implementation-defined, but no exceptions are produced.

```cs
T* operator ++(T* x);
T* operator --(T* x);
```

## Pointer Arithmetic

```cs
T* operator +(T* x, int y);
T* operator +(T* x, uint y);
T* operator +(T* x, long y);
T* operator +(T* x, ulong y);
T* operator +(int x, T* y);
T* operator +(uint x, T* y);
T* operator +(long x, T* y);
T* operator +(ulong x, T* y);
T* operator –(T* x, int y);
T* operator –(T* x, uint y);
T* operator –(T* x, long y);
T* operator –(T* x, ulong y);
long operator –(T* x, T* y);
```

## Pointer comparison

See [Void Pointer](./5.%20Void%20Pointer.md#Built-in%20operator)

## Operator priority

- `++` or `--` > `*`, `*p++` is equivalent to `*(p++)`.

## `sizeof` Operator
