# Pointer Conversion

## What does conversion do?

Conversions between two pointer types never change the actual pointer value. In other words, a conversion from one pointer type to another has no effect on the underlying address given by the pointer.

## Implicit Conversion

- Any pointer type to `void*`.
- `null` to any pointer type.

## Explicit Conversion

- `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, or `ulong` to any pointer type.
- any pointer type to any other pointer type.
- any pointer type to `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, or `ulong`.
