# Grouping and Captured Groups

## Grouping alternatives

A better syntax for `\bJane\b|\bJanet\b` is `\b(Jane|Janet)\b` using `()` for grouping alternatives.
However this also creates a captured group, if you don't need any captured group to reuse, see [Noncapturing](#noncapturing-groups)

## Noncapturing groups

`\b(?:Jane|Janet)\b` disables group capturing using `(?:)`, it won't capture the group when matching, benefit to better performance.

## Group with mode modifier

Use any of `(?i:<regex>)` or `(?s:<regex>)` or `(?m:<regex>)` to annotate grouped alternatives

- `\b(?i:Jane|Janet)\b`

To combine different modes:

- `(?ism:<regex>)` enables `case-insensitive`, `singleline` and `multiline`
- `(?-ism:<regex>)` disables `case-insensitive`, `singleline` and `multiline`
- `(?i-sm:<regex>)` enables `case-sensitive` and disables `singleline` and `multiline`

## Backreference

Reference the first nine capturing groups with a backslash followed by a single digit one through nine(`\1` to `\9`). For groups 10 through 99, use `\10` to `\99`
The following regex matches date like `2008-08-08` and `2007-07-07`.

```regex
\b\d\d(\d\d)-\1-\1\b
```

If backreferences are before any capturing groups, they fails to match anything.

## Named group and named backrefernces

Assign a descriptive name for groups instead of numbers.

The previous example can be written as following:

```regex
\b\d\d(?<tailing>\d\d)-\k<tailing>-\1\b
```
