# Match One of Many Alternatives

`cat|dog|bird` matches one of `cat`, `dog` and `bird`.

> The order of the alternatives in the regex matters only when two of them *can match at the same position* in the string.

Alternatives are *short-circuited*(or *eager*). If the previous alternative matches, the rest won't continue to match at current position.

So `Jane|Janet` can't match `Janet` in `Her name is Janet`, only `Jane` is matched.
To match word by word, use `\bJane\b|\bJanet\b` instead.
