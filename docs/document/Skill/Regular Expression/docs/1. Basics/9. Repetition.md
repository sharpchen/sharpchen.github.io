# Repetition

## Fixed repetition

The *quantifier* `{n}`, where *`n`* is an nonnegative integer, repeats the preceding regex token *`n`* times

```regex
\b\d{100}\b
```

- `\d\d{0}` is equivalent to `\d`
- `\d\d{1}` is equivalent to `\d\d`

## Variable repetition

The *quantifier* *`{n,m}`*, where *`n`* is an nonnegative integer, and *`m`* is an nonnegative integer greater than *`n`*.

*The following matches 1 to 8 digits*:

```regex
\b\d{1,8}\b
```

- `\d{10,10}` is equivalent to `\d`

## Infinite repetition

- `\d{n,}` matches `n` or more times of digits
- `\d{1,}` is equivalent to `\d+`
- `\d{0,}` is equivalent to `\d*`

## Optional match

- `\d{0,1}` marks the digit can be omit in context
- `\d{0,1}` is equivalent to `\d?`
- matches empty string when the preceding token is absent

## Repeating groups

- `(?:abc){1,3}` matches one to three occurrences of `abc`
- `(?:abc)+` matches one or more occurrences of `abc`
- `(?:abc)?` matches any `abc` and empty strings
