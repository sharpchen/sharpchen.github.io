# Match Any Character

- `.` matches any character except line breaks
- `.` matches any character with api option

```cs
_ = new Regex(@".", RegexOptions.Singleline);
// or
_ = new Regex(@"(?s).");
```

- `[\s\S]` and `[\w\W]` and `[\d\D]` match any character

:::tip
Use `.` only when you really want to allow any character. Use a character class or negated character class in any other situation.

## Mode modifier

Use `(?s)`/`(?-s)` to enable/disable `singleline` mode in regex literal
