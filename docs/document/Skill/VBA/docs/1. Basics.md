# Basics

## Naming Convention

|Identifier|Naming|
|---|---|
|Variable|camel|
|Parameter|camel or Pascal|
|Constants|Pascal|
|Subs and Functions|Pascal|
|Classes|Pascal|
|Modules|Pascal|
|Interfaces|Pascal starts with `I`|

## Comment

Starts with single quote `'`.

```vb
' This is a comment...
```

## Variable

```vb
' Declaration
Dim condition As Boolean
Dim number As Integer
' Assignment
condition = False
number = 100
```

> [!NOTE]
> Visual Basic was designed as type suffixing when declaring a variable, same for parameters.

## Subroutine and Function

- `Sub` is a concept like procedure that does not return any value.

```vb
Sub Hello()
    MsgBox "Hello!"
End Sub
```

- `Function` returns.

```vb
Function Add(Number1 As Integer, Number2 As Integer) As Integer
    Add = Number1 + Number2
End Function

result = Add(1, 2)
' Or without brackets
result = Add 1, 2
```

## Control flow

### `If`

```vb
If Not Condition Then
    ' ...
Else
    ' ...
End If
```

### `For` .. `To` .. `Next`

```vb
For i = 1 To 10
    MsgBox "Hello" ' 10 times
Next i
For i = 1 To 10 Step 2
    MsgBox "Hello" ' 5 times
Next i
```

::: tip
For loop allows inline declaration for the iterator, we don't have to declare the `i` outside the scope.
:::

### `For Each` .. `Next`

```vb
For Each element In Array(1, 2, 3)
    MsgBox element
Next element
```

:::tip
Use `Array()` to initialize a array
:::

### `Do While` .. `Loop`

```vb
Do While condition
    ' Code to execute while condition is true
Loop

```

### `Select` .. `Case`

```vb
Select Case expression
    Case value1
        ' code to execute if expression equals value1
    Case value2
        ' code to execute if expression equals value2
    Case Else
        ' default
End Select
```

### `Exit`

Exits a block of code prematurely, such as `Exit For`, `Exit Do`, `Exit Sub`, `Exit Function`, etc.

```vb
If condition Then Exit Sub
```

### `With` statement

In Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the `With` statement is used to execute a series of statements on a single object or user-defined type without requalifying the name of the object or type. This can make your code cleaner and more efficient, especially when you're working with objects that have long or complicated names.

Here's the basic syntax of a `With` statement:

```vb
With object
    .property1 = value1
    .property2 = value2
    .method1
End With
```

In this example, `object` is the object that you're working with, `property1` and `property2` are properties of the object, and `method1` is a method of the object. The `With` statement lets you set the properties and call the method without having to write the name of the object each time.

Here's a more concrete example:

```vb
With Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1")
    .Value = "Hello, World!"
    .Font.Bold = True
    .Interior.Color = RGB(255, 0, 0)
End With
```

In this example, the `With` statement is used to work with the cell A1 on Sheet1. The value of the cell is set to "Hello, World!", the font is set to bold, and the background color is set to yellow, all without having to requalify the cell reference each time.
