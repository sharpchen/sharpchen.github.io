# How Web Works

## What's URL

Uniformed Resource Location(URL) is a reference or address used to access resources on the internet. 
It specifies the location of a resource and the protocol used to retrieve it, allowing web browsers and other clients to locate and interact with the resource.

```http
protocol://hostname:<port>/path?query#fragment
```

- protocol: can be `http`, `https`, `ftp` etc.
- port: `80` for `http` by defualt and `443` for `https`.

## What's HTTP

Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) is a language used for communicating through internet.

- Methods
    - `PUT`
    - `GET`
    - `POST`
    - `DELETE`
- Status Codes: indicating the result of request.

### HTTPS

Hypertext Transfer Protocol with Encryption(HTTPS) encrypts messages between clients and server.

### HTTP as a language

- Request example

```http
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36

## DOM

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. 
It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects, where each node in the tree corresponds to a part of the document, 
such as an element, attribute, or text content. 
The DOM allows scripts (usually JavaScript) to dynamically access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of web pages.

    Browser->>Server: GET /image.png (HTTP Request)
