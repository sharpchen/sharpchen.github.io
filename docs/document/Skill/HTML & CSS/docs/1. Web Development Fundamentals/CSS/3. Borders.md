# Borders

Synopsis: `border: <thickness> <border_style> <color>`

```css
.foo {
    border: 1px solid red;
}
.bar {
    border: 1px dotted red;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Almost all borders are `solid` nowadays, we don't need any other style of borders.

## Specific border properties

### Sub-Borders

Border of an element can be styled separately.

```css
.foo {
    border: 1px solid red;
    border-top: 5px solid black; /* [!code ++]  */
    border-left: 5px solid black; /* [!code ++]  */
}
```

*`border` is the shorthand property of `border-top, ...`.*

> [!NOTE]
> Properties like `border` are called `shorthand property`, they can control multiple style targets of an element with same value.
> Another common shorthand property is `margin`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a shorthand property is defined after specific properties, it overwrites the previous values. The order matters!

### Border width

`border-width` is also a shorthand property, has same usage as `margin`.

```css
.bar {
    border: 1px dotted red;
    border-width: 10px 5px 3px 4px; /* for top-right-bottom-left */
}
```

### Border style

```css
.foo {
    border-style: solid dashed dotted double;
}
```
