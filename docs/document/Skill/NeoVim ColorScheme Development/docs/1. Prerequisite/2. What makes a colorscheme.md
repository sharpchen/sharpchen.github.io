# What makes a colorscheme?

NeoVim colorscheme is basically a bunch of scripts that can be written in `vimscript` or `lua`.
So it depends on how you organize and design your scripts to make it easier to implement.

## Project structure

This is a typical structure of a NeoVim colorscheme.

- `colors` should contain all entry files of colorscheme
- `lua` should contain other modules that helps to make the colorscheme

```plain
.
├── colors
├── lua
├── README.md
└── LICENSE
```

However, it's not required to have `lua` folder, you can have your script inside any folder.
But the reason for having `lua` folder is, all plugins(including colorscheme) runs on a lua environment inside NeoVim, which will automatically append the folder into `package.path`

```lua
-- This is how Neovim implicitly handles the `lua` folder:
package.path = package.path .. ';' .. vim.fn.stdpath('config') .. '/lua/?.lua;' .. vim.fn.stdpath('config') .. '/lua/?/init.lua'
```

The difference made here is, **you should not import module with leading `lua` in modules inside `colors`**

```lua
-- ./colors/my_colorscheme.lua
require('lua.my_util_under_lua_folder') -- error!
require('my_util_under_lua_folder') -- valid!
-- ...
```

While if you use any other named folder to store your modules, you should include the name.

```plain
.
├── colors
├── src
├── README.md
└── LICENSE
```

```lua
-- ./colors/my_colorscheme.lua
require('src.my_util_under_lua_folder') -- do this!
```

## Entry file

The entry file of a colorscheme is a script that runs when NeoVim call the command `:colo <your_colorscheme_name>`. And all entry files will be injected by their filename without extension as the name of colorscheme, you can check them with `:colo <Tab>`.

## Loading local colorscheme

So let's create some empty entry files for our variants.

```bash
touch light.lua dark.lua dawn.lua rain.lua
```

```plain
.
├── colors
│   ├── light.lua
│   ├── dark.lua
│   ├── dawn.lua
│   └── rain.lua
└── lua

```

While before testing, we should load our colorscheme using a plugin manager.

```lua
-- using Lazy.nvim
{ dir = 'path/to/your/colorscheme_project' }
```

Now restart NeoVim, type `:colo <Tab>` you can see your colorscheme loaded. But you can't switch to them now, we haven't implement them yet!

## Wrap up

To create a NeoVim colorscheme project, it should fits the structure mentioned above, and to test whether it can be loaded into NeoVim, use a plugin manager.
In next chapter, we're going to talk about how to highlight certain tokens including your code and languages as well as colors for plugin interfaces.
