# How to highlight a thing

## What's a highlight group?

Each colorizable thing, such like keyword and identifier in your code, as well as user interfaces like border of a window, buffer background has a name called `Highlight group`. In other words, `Highlight group` is the key of thing we expected to be highlighted. By reassigning style of a highlight group programmatically, we can make colorscheme working as expected.

:::info
NeoVim has built-in highlight groups and third-party plugins can inject new highlight groups, please check the documentation for specific plugin. To check all injected highlight groups, use `:hi <CR>`
:::

### Treesitter specific

Treesitter would inject many default highlight group and language specific highlight groups by installed parsers. Typically starts with `@` such as `@function`, `@local.definition.function`.

### Lsp specific

Each language server for specific language can inject new highlight groups for highlighting code. They're called **semantic token**

### Inspect highlight group

When cursor is located on a character, use `:Inspect` to check its highlight group.

## Highlight your first thing by nvim api

NeoVim provides a api to highlight things, this allows you use shaped object in lua to represent a style for your highlight group. Or you need to write complex command by using formatted string.

Put this code piece in one of your entry file of your colorscheme, and restart NeoVim to load it. You will find buffer background turned white!

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'Normal', { bg = '#FFFFFF' })
```

## What makes a style for highlight group?

Typed style definition can be represented like this by LDoc.

- NeoVim only supports `#RRGGBB` color, alpha is not valid.

```lua
---@class TokenStyle
---@field fg? string #RRGGBB
---@field bg? string #RRGGBB
---@field sp? string #RRGGBB
---@field blend? integer 1 to 100
---@field bold? boolean
---@field standout? boolean
---@field underline? boolean
---@field undercurl? boolean
---@field underdouble? boolean
---@field underdotted? boolean
---@field underdashed? boolean
---@field strikethrough? boolean
---@field italic? boolean
---@field reverse? boolean
---@field nocombine? boolean
---@field link? string
---@field default? {}
---@field ctermfg? string
---@field ctermbg? string
---@field cterm? {}
---@field force? boolean if true force update the highlight group when it exists.
---@field altfont? boolean enable alternative font in nvim 0.9
