# Submodule

Submodule can be useful when a project is dependent on another isolated project on build.
Such as a project your team is working on but maintained separately, or third party dependencies that are not available from any package manager.

## Add Submodule

```sh
git submodule add <repository_url> <path_to_submodule>
```

Details of submodules can be inspected from `.gitmodules`
