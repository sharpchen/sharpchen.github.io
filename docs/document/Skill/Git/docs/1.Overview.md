# Overview

## Concepts

1. **Changes & Status**:
    - a file can be *tracked* or *untracked* which indicates whether the file is recognized by git as part of the repository.
    - a change includes *added*, *deleted*, *modified* at the minimum unit of lines.
    - staging meaning that you're selectively picking untracked files or changes into bucket, and waiting for **committing** them.
2. **Commit**: With staged changes, you're ready to generate a new snapshot, which is called *commit*.
    - commits constructs a acyclic graph representing all revisions of your repository.
    - you can rollback to one snapshot by `reset`.
3. **Branching**: a special form of commit that can represent a divergence of the commit graph.
    - each branch is essentially a **dynamic head commit** of that divergence, it can traverse back to its start point to delineated the branch.
    - branching is all about how to attach/detach a commit
4. **History & Reset**
    - inspect local history `reflog` and commit history `log`
        - each history is just a commit, tracked or wild, attached or detached
    - use `bisect` to binary search the commit introduced *bad* things.
    - revert changes of a commit by `git revert`(with *revert commit*)
    - reset to commit with altered history
5. **Synchronization**: working with remotes and locals
    - download remote branches by `fetch`
    - `merge` or `rebase` remote branches
    - use `pull` as shortcut of `fetch` plus `merge/rebase`

## Getting Help

`git help <subcommand>` is the builtin command to show man page of the specified subcommand on UNIX or opening documentation html page on Windows

For example, open documentation for `git clone` subcommand:

```sh
git help clone
```
