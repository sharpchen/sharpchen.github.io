# Overview

## Concepts

1. **Changes & Status**:
    - a file can be *tracked* or *untracked* which indicates whether the file is recognized by git as part of the repository.
    - a change includes *added*, *deleted*, *modified* at the minimum unit of lines.
    - staging meaning that you're selectively picking untracked files or changes into bucket, and waiting for **committing** them.
2. **Commit**: With staged changes, you're ready to generate a new snapshot, which is called *commit*.
    - commits constructs a acyclic graph representing all revisions of your repository.
    - you can rollback to one snapshot by `reset`.
3. **Branching**: a special form of commit that can represent a divergence of the commit graph.
    - each branch is essentially a **dynamic head commit** of that divergence, it can traverse back to its start point to delineated the branch.
    - a branch can merge to another on `pull` or `merge`
4. **Synchronization**: working with remotes and locals
