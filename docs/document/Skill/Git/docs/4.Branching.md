# Branching

Each branch was deviated from certain commit of another branch, and could have its own `HEAD` when actual divergence was applied.
So a branch besides the main branch is essentially a sequence of commits starting with a divergence from another branch.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Branch is a concept upon commits, the branch is sometimes equivalent to the latest commit of that branch.
> A branch is just a special commit points to latest commit of that branch and can trace back to the divergence.

## Branch Identifier

- branch name
- `@{upstream}` or `@{u}`: refer to the local upstream

## Branch Inspection

A branch has its dedicated text file containing its latest commit hash at `./.git/refs/heads/<branch>`

```console
$ cat ./.git/refs/heads/msbuid_ls
4bfbc0c67e39f5615e0cdc4535611af1e71040d8
```

If the latest commit hash is the only thing the branch knows, how could it collect all of the commits when git requires to?
The fact is, commits are chained with their parent and child, so git can track back along to the point where the branch was diverged.

## Branch Manipulation

> [!NOTE]
> See `git help branch` and `tldr git-branch`.
> Or `git help switch` and `tldr git-switch`.

- `git branch`
    - `-d|--delete`: delete branch
    - `-m|--move`: rename branch
    - `-c|--copy`: copy branch
