# Git History & Reset

- `git log`: commit logs that can be synchronized with remotes.
- `git reflog`: local operation logs which is more detailed but limited to local repository.
    - **dynamic pointers** such as `HEAD` and branches have their dedicated reflog on their own.

## Commit History Query

- `-<n>`: limits count of commit logs
- `--skip=<n>`: skip count
- ..., see: `git help log` in *Commit Limiting* section

### History Exclusion

Use `^` to exclude commits from certain points, such as `git log ^main foo` to exclude commits from `main` but keep commits from `foo`.

Example: show commits within branch `pwsh_es` but not in `master`:
```console
$ git log ^master pwsh_es
* e8284ebb96d8 (origin/pwsh_es, pwsh_es) maintainers: add sharpchen
* c0c964d8ae68 powershell-editor-services: init at 4.1.0

$ git log master..pwsh_es
* e8284ebb96d8 (origin/pwsh_es, pwsh_es) maintainers: add sharpchen
* c0c964d8ae68 powershell-editor-services: init at 4.1.0
```
