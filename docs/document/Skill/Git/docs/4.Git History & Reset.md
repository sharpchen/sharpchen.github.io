# Git History & Reset

- `git log`: commit logs that generated by traversing commit graph for each time you inspect it.
- `git reflog`: local operation logs which is more detailed but limited to local repository.
    - **dynamic pointers** such as `HEAD` and branches have their dedicated reflog on their own.
    - stores at `.git/logs/**`

> [!NOTE]
> `git reflog` is generally faster to print than `git log` on a **large repository**, because reflog is a literal text file stored at `.git/logs/`
> While `git log` has to traverse the large graph dynamically which would take a longer time to execute.

## Commit History Query

- `-<n>`: limits count of commit logs
- `--skip=<n>`: skip count
- ..., see: `git help log` in *Commit Limiting* section

### History Exclusion

Use `^` to exclude commits from certain points, such as `git log ^main foo` to exclude commits from `main` but keep commits from `foo`.

Example: show commits within branch `pwsh_es` but not in `master`:
```console
$ git log ^master pwsh_es
* e8284ebb96d8 (origin/pwsh_es, pwsh_es) maintainers: add sharpchen
* c0c964d8ae68 powershell-editor-services: init at 4.1.0

$ git log master..pwsh_es
* e8284ebb96d8 (origin/pwsh_es, pwsh_es) maintainers: add sharpchen
* c0c964d8ae68 powershell-editor-services: init at 4.1.0
```
