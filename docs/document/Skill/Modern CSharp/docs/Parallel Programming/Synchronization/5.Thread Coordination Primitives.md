# Thread Coordination Primitives

## Barrier

`Barrier` allows multiple threads to execute in same phase and not moving to next phase until all participant signaled.

- `Barrier` must have a specified count of participant threads
- `barrier.SignalAndWait()` increases the inner counter in `Barrier`
- phase is completed when the number of threads signaled reaches **the count** of barrier
- new phase is started when any thread signaled made the counter increased from 0 to 1
- each thread would not continue until sufficient count of threads have signaled(participated)

```cs
// you may register a event on phase finished // [!code highlight] 
Barrier barrier = new(3, b => { // [!code highlight] 
    Console.WriteLine($"phase {b.CurrentPhaseNumber} has finished"); // [!code highlight] 
}); // [!code highlight] 

var tasks = Enumerable.Range(1, 3).Select(_ => {
    return Task.Run(() => {
        // notifying barrier that this thread has entered
        // the counter inside increments
        // and all participants would continue when the count hits limit
        // and the count would reset to the sepcified
        barrier.SignalAndWait(); // signal for the first time to enter phase 0 // [!code highlight] 
        Console.WriteLine($"Task {Task.CurrentId} is handling phase {barrier.CurrentPhaseNumber}");
        barrier.SignalAndWait(); // signal again indicating to enter phase 1
    });
});

Task.WaitAll(tasks);

// phase 0 has finished
// Task 1 is handling phase 1
// Task 3 is handling phase 1
// Task 2 is handling phase 1
// phase 1 has finished
```

## CountDownEvent

`CountDownEvent` is a primitive to block certain threads until a count down has reached

```cs
CountdownEvent @event = new(3);

var waiting = Task.Run(() => {
    Console.WriteLine("This task is waiting for count down completion");
    @event.Wait(); // blocking until count down finished // [!code highlight] 
    Console.WriteLine("Task finished after count down");
});


var countdown = Enumerable.Range(1, 3).Select(_ => {
    return Task.Run(() => {
        Thread.Sleep(1000);
        Console.WriteLine("count down");
        @event.Signal();
    });
});

Task.WaitAll([waiting, .. countdown]);

// This task is waiting for count down finished
// count down
// count down
// count down
// Task finished after count down
```

> [!NOTE]
> You may increase a count dynamically using `AddCount` or `TryAddCount`

## ManualResetEventSlim

`ManualResetEventSlim` behaves somewhat like a one-time counter that counts up to 1, it can be used to implement a continuation.

```cs
// optionally set initialState impling whther the event is already signaled
ManualResetEventSlim @event = new(initialState: false);

var waiting = Task.Run(() => {
    Console.WriteLine("waiting for one time signal");
    @event.Wait(); // [!code highlight] 
    Console.WriteLine("post action triggered");
    @event.Wait();
    if (@event.Wait(1000)) { }
    Console.WriteLine("still reachable since the event has to be reset manually to regain blocking"); // [!code highlight] 
    // reset the count to regain blocking
    @event.Reset(); // [!code warning] 
    @event.Wait(); // infinite blocking since now no signal would be sent again // [!code warning] 
});

var count = Task.Run(() => {
    Console.WriteLine("perform something and then signal");
    @event.Set();
});

waiting.Wait();
```

> [!NOTE]
> Use `AutoResetEvent` if auto reset on count is required which automatically reset state when wait succeeded
>```cs
>AutoResetEvent @event = new(initialState: false);
>
>var waiting = Task.Run(() => {
>    Console.WriteLine("waiting for one time signal");
>    _ = @event.WaitOne(); // [!code highlight] 
>    Console.WriteLine("post action triggered");
>    _ = @event.WaitOne(); // would hang here forever since state was reset automatically // [!code warning] 
>    Console.WriteLine("not reachable!!"); // [!code warning] 
>});
>
>var countdown = Task.Run(() => {
>    Console.WriteLine("perform something and then signal");
>    _ = @event.Set();
>});
>
>waiting.Wait();
>```

## SemaphoreSlim

`SemaphoreSlim` allows limited count of multiple threads to execute concurrently and release the hold dynamically.

- `semaphore.Wait(...)`: would block current thread when count is 0, so you should release to increase the count somewhere to make sure it continues
- `semaphore.Release(int?)`: to release specific count so other threads could continue
    - returns a previous count of semaphore
    - `maxCount` on constructor came into play since release is a manual control.
    - when `maxCount` was reached, `SemaphoreFullException` would be thrown.

So the *count* is essentially a limit of how many threads could continue for now, if the count reaches 0, all other threads not entered semaphore have to wait.
Remember to *release* to get the count back so other thread could enter semaphore later.

```cs
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Runtime.ConstrainedExecution;

// three in a row, can dynamically increase the count to 10 at most
SemaphoreSlim semaphore = new(initialCount: 3, maxCount: 10); 

int shared = 0;

var tasks = Enumerable.Range(1, 100).Select(n => {
    return Task.Run(() => {
        semaphore.Wait(); // would block when count is 0 // [!code highlight] 

        Thread.Sleep(1000);

        Console.WriteLine(n); // order is not guaranteed by semaphore
        Interlocked.Add(ref shared, 1); // multiple thread would still come in so protection is neeeded

        _ = semaphore.Release(); // [!code highlight] 
    });
});

Task.WaitAll(tasks);

Debug.Assert(shared is 100);
```
