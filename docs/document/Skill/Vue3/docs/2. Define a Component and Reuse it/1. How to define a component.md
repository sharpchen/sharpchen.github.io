# How to define a component

## Define a component

Let's start with a simple example. How much difference you can tell?

::: code-group

```razor[razor]
<button @onclick="IncrementCount">Count is: @_count</button>

@code {
    private int _count;
    private void IncrementCount() => _count++;
}
```

```vue[vue]{2}
<template>
  <button @click="count++">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
    import { ref } from 'vue'
    const count = ref(0)
</script>

<style scoped>
  button {
    font-weight: bold;
  }
</style>
```

## Difference

### Reactivity

- The view model of razor page would be compiled into a class that every field or property is reactive.
- However, vue requires explicit reactivity with api like `ref()`, `reactive()`.

::: tip
[Prefer `ref()` than `reactive()`](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html#limitations-of-reactive)

### Event Handling

- razor supports method delegation, but doesn't support raw expression like `@(_count++)`.
- vue supports both expression and function reference.

### `CSS` Isolation

- `Blazor` isolates `css` file with the separate file named as the same as component.
- `Vue` could specify styles for component in scope using `<style scoped>...<style/>`

### Inheritance

- razor component inherits from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.ComponentBase`.
