# Installation

## Enable flake(optional)

It's recommended to use home-manager together with flake enabled.
If you haven't enabled flake yet, do the following for single user:

```bash
echo 'experimental-features = nix-command flakes' >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
```

or the following for multi-users:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "experimental-features = nix-command flakes" >> /etc/nix/nix.conf'
```

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation only uses home-manager with flakes.

## Installation

### Add channel for home-manager

- Unstable

```bash
nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz home-manager && nix-channel --update
```

- Stable(24.05)

```bash
nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/release-24.05.tar.gz home-manager && nix-channel --update
```

> [!TIP]
> For version number, see: [Nix Channels](https://channels.nixos.org/) 

### Install

```bash
nix-shell '<home-manager>' -A install
```

:::info
`<home-manager>` is the channel alias you set in previous step. Replace it with yours if necessary.
:::

After this command, `home-manager` should be available.

## Initialize home-manager

Initialize home-manager config by:

```bash
home-manager init
```

This command generates `flake.nix`, `home.nix` under `~/.config/home-manager/`
- `flake.nix`: metadata used for home-manager.
- `home.nix`: entry point of home-manager. Uses attribute set from `flake.nix`.

## Apply home-manager profile

By default, `home-manager init{:sh}` generates by current username.

```nix
# generated in home.nix
home.username = "sharpchen";
```

So it should be valid to switch to the profile with following:

```sh
home-manager switch --flake ~/.config/home-manager#$USER
```

This is how you restore a home-manager profile for a user.
And this also implies home-manager can handle multiple users' profiles.

> [!TIP]
> Set an command alias for `home-manager switch`!
