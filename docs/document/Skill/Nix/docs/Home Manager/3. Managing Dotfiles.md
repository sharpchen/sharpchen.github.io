# Managing Dotfiles

Managing config files is what a traiditional pm can't do.
Home manager provides some approaches to do it.

- `home.file`: directly creates a file with content to a path.
    - `text`: use string to represent content right inside nix file.
    - `source`: specifiy a target path to a file as the source of config.
- `xdg.configFile`: use xdg config path as base path.
- symlink
