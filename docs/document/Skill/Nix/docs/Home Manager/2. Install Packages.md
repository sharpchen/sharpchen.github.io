# Install Packages

There's two ways to install packages using home-manager.

- `home.packages`: for any package exists in a channel.
- `programs.<pkg_name>`: for build in options for certain package by home-manager.

## Install from a channel

`home.packages` provides a explicit way to include what package should be installed.
`pkgs` here is a channel unpacked from the`flake.nix`.

```nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }: {
  home.packages = with pkgs; [
    git     # package names came from channel
    neovim
    ripgrep
    openssh
    lazygit
  ];
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> `pkgs` is the unique attribute in the function of `home.nix`, it should be always available.

> [!TIP]
> How do I know the package name?
> Search on [NixOS Search](https://search.nixos.org/packages) to find the package you want.

## Install by builtin option

For some packages, home-manager provides builtin options to set them up.
It seems `pkgs` is not involved, actually it was used by default for `programs.<pkg_name>`.
So we should always make sure `pkgs` exists as a parameter for the function in `home.nix`, should be discussed later.

```nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }: {
  programs.git.enable = true;
}
```

*`enable` implies that the package will be installed implicitly.*

### Use another channel

Home-manager options also provides a `package` attribute for not using default `pkgs`.

```nix
programs.git = {
    enable = true;
    package = unstable.git; # [!code highlight] 
};
```

> [!NOTE]
> `unstable` here should be another channel imported as one of the attribute of the function parameter.
> We'll discuss how to use multiple channels in later chapter.

Only few packages has builtin options, how do I know what attribute I can set?
Check out [Home-manager Options](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.xhtml) and search `programs.<pkg_name>`
