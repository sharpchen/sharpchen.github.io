# Add Migration

The common solution is using `C#` itself as the language of migration script.
So we'll need 
- A package that provides the migration features 
- A cli tool to auto generate source files represents the migration.

## Add dependency

```sh
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
```

```sh
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-ef
```

## Add a migration

### How migration organized

The following will generate a class with two parts inside your project as `Migrations/<timestamp>_<class_name>.cs` and `Migration/<timestamp>_<class_name>.Designer.cs`.

```sh
dotnet-ef migrations add <class_name>
```

- `Migration.Up` will be invoked when upgrading to this version of migration.
- `Migration.Down` will be invoked when reverting to previous migration.

```cs
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Migrations;

/// <inheritdoc />
public partial class <class_name> : Migration
{
    /// <inheritdoc />
    protected override void Up(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder) { /* ... */ }

    /// <inheritdoc />
    protected override void Down(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder) { /* ... */ }
}
```

Another part of your migration takes the job of modeling, it stores the status of the schema when generating this migration.

```cs
[DbContext(typeof(MoviesContext))]
[Migration("<timestamp>_<class_name>")]
partial class <class_name>
{
    /// <inheritdoc />
    protected override void BuildTargetModel(ModelBuilder modelBuilder) { /* ... */ }
}
```
### How snapshot organized

Adding migration also generates or updates snapshot of the current schema, it represents the current status so that migrations can have it as a reference to do reversion or upgrade

:::info
- A migration was only generated once.
- Snapshot updates on every migration.

> [!WARNING]
> You should never manually edit snapshot or migrations except altering columns
