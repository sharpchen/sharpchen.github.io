# Primitive vs Entity

## What you might have noticed

```vue{9,10}
<script setup lang="ts">
    import { Cartesian3, Viewer, createOsmBuildingsAsync } from 'cesium';
    import 'cesium/Build/Cesium/Widgets/widgets.css';
    import { onMounted, ref, shallowRef } from 'vue';
    const globe = ref<Element | null>(null);
    const viewer = shallowRef<Viewer | null>(null);
    onMounted(() => {
        viewer.value = new Viewer(globe.value as Element);
        viewer.value.scene.primitives.add({});
        viewer.value.entities.add({});
    });
</script>

## What is `primitive` in cesium?

In CesiumJS, the term "primitive" refers to a fundamental building block for rendering and visualization within the CesiumJS library. A primitive represents a graphical object or entity that can be rendered on the globe, such as a point, polyline, polygon, or model. Primitives are part of the Cesium rendering pipeline and are used to efficiently display various types of geospatial data.

Here are some common types of primitives in CesiumJS:

1. **Cesium.Primitive:**
   - The most generic primitive, allowing you to define custom rendering logic.
   - Often used to create custom visualizations.

2. **Cesium.PointPrimitive:**
   - Represents a point in 3D space.
   - Used for rendering individual points on the globe.

3. **Cesium.PolylinePrimitive:**
   - Represents a polyline (line connecting multiple points).
   - Used for rendering lines or paths.

4. **Cesium.PolygonPrimitive:**
   - Represents a polygon with multiple vertices.
   - Used for rendering filled or outlined polygons.

5. **Cesium.ModelPrimitive:**
   - Represents a 3D model.
   - Used for rendering 3D models at specific locations on the globe.

6. **Cesium.Billboard:**
   - Represents an image or icon that is aligned to the screen.
   - Used for rendering images, icons, or markers.

Primitives in CesiumJS are part of the overall scene rendering process, and they allow you to visualize and interact with geospatial data in a flexible and efficient manner. Primitives can be added to the Cesium scene, and they are often created based on specific data sources or custom visualizations that you want to display on the Cesium globe.

## Entity api

```ts
export class EntityCollection {
    constructor(owner?: DataSource | CompositeEntityCollection);
    /**
     * Prevents {@link EntityCollection#collectionChanged} events from being raised
     * until a corresponding call is made to {@link EntityCollection#resumeEvents}, at which
     * point a single event will be raised that covers all suspended operations.
     * This allows for many items to be added and removed efficiently.
     * This function can be safely called multiple times as long as there
     * are corresponding calls to {@link EntityCollection#resumeEvents}.
     */
    suspendEvents(): void;
    /**
     * Resumes raising {@link EntityCollection#collectionChanged} events immediately
     * when an item is added or removed.  Any modifications made while while events were suspended
     * will be triggered as a single event when this function is called.
     * This function is reference counted and can safely be called multiple times as long as there
     * are corresponding calls to {@link EntityCollection#resumeEvents}.
     */
    resumeEvents(): void;
    /**
     * Gets the event that is fired when entities are added or removed from the collection.
     * The generated event is a {@link EntityCollection.CollectionChangedEventCallback}.
     */
    readonly collectionChanged: Event<EntityCollection.CollectionChangedEventCallback>;
    
    readonly id: string;

    readonly values: Entity[];
    /**
     * Gets whether or not this entity collection should be
     * displayed.  When true, each entity is only displayed if
     * its own show property is also true.
     */
    show: boolean;
    /**
     * Gets the owner of this entity collection, ie. the data source or composite entity collection which created it.
     */
    readonly owner: DataSource | CompositeEntityCollection;
    /**
     * Computes the maximum availability of the entities in the collection.
     * If the collection contains a mix of infinitely available data and non-infinite data,
     * it will return the interval pertaining to the non-infinite data only.  If all
     * data is infinite, an infinite interval will be returned.
     * @returns The availability of entities in the collection.
     */
    computeAvailability(): TimeInterval;

    add(entity: Entity | Entity.ConstructorOptions): Entity;

    remove(entity: Entity): boolean;

    contains(entity: Entity): boolean;

    removeById(id: string): boolean;

    removeAll(): void;

    getById(id: string): Entity | undefined;
    
    getOrCreateEntity(id: string): Entity;
}
