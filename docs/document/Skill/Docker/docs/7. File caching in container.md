# File caching in container

## What is layer

In Docker, a "layer" refers to a read-only filesystem that contains files and metadata that are used to build a Docker image. Docker images are composed of multiple layers, and each layer represents a set of changes or instructions in the Dockerfile. Layers are stacked on top of each other, and when you run a Docker container, a writable container layer is added on top of the read-only layers.

Check the layers of a built image using `docker history <container>`

```bash
docker history vue-app

```

According to the result, changes of `npm install` made `223MB` each time we build.

To get a caching and reusability for those packages, what can we do?

Well, for each layer, docker will check all changes(files for example) between the current and previous. If not change applied in the layer, the next `RUN` will not be executed.

## Implementation

```dockerfile
FROM node:alpine
WORKDIR /app
RUN apk upgrade
# copy package.json and package-lock.json
# before npm install
COPY package*.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN addgroup app && adduser -S -G app app
USER app
ENV API_URL=http://api.myapp.com
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["npm", "run", "serve"]
```

If now rebuild image twice, we can see all layers were cached for sure since we didn't change anything. So try it out with adding/removing dependencies from current node project to see what happens.

```bash
docker build --tag vue-app .
