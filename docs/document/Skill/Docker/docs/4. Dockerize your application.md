# Dockerize your application

## DockerFile example

Add a dockerfile in your project root.

> Notice: the file name is `Dockerfile` with no extension, do not misspell.

For a simple vue project, we need a node image.
Prefer alpine, a much smaller distribution.

```dockerfile
FROM node:21-alpine3.17
```

Back to terminal, we build it. There we go.

`docker build --tag vue-app .`

The `.` refers to which folder the dockerfile is placed.

## Include files into image

> All folders and files are file in linux.

`COPY` and `ADD` are two different keywords to do the same thing: **Add files into a image**

### `COPY`

```dockerfile
FROM node:21-alpine3.17
COPY <...source> <dest>
```

`COPY` supports syntax just like linux, we can apply multiple files or pattern to represent the source.
`<dest>` supports both relative and absolute, it refers to the path in container.
This approach doesn't allow files containing any space, so we use array to pass the args.

```dockerfile
FROM node:21-alpine3.17
COPY ["package.json", "tsconfig.json"] <dest>
```

### `ADD`

`ADD` keyword has an additional feature, add from url.
We can compose `ADD` and `COPY` together.

#### From Url

```dockerfile
FROM node:21-alpine3.17
COPY ["package.json", "tsconfig.json"] <dest>
ADD  http://.../route <dest>
```

If we pass a compressed file to `ADD`, it will automatically decompress it.

#### Auto Decompression

```dockerfile
FROM node:21-alpine3.17
COPY ["package.json", "tsconfig.json"] <dest>
ADD  ./files.zip/ <dest>
```

### Rebuild to see what happens

Now let's rebuild the image.

```dockerfile
FROM node:alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
```

`docker build --tag vue-app .` There are tons of files(184.22MB ) were transferred into image, mostly are native dependencies.

```bash
docker build --tag vue-app .

And check the file system using shell. We are right in the default directory `/app` as `WORKDIR` specified.

```bash
docker run -it vue-app sh

/app #
/app # ls
Dockerfile         babel.config.js    package-lock.json  public             tsconfig.json
README.md          node_modules       package.json       src                vue.config.js
/app #
```

## Exclude files

For native dependencies, they are unnecessarily copied into image.

### .dockerignore

`.dockerignore`(all lower case) is the file to specify those you want to exclude from being copied.

Now, ignore `node_modules/` where those packages are stored!

```txt
node_modules/
```

And rebuild the image, transferred files reduced to 755B.

```bash
docker build --tag vue-app .

But without these dependencies, how do we run the application in container?
That's why `RUN` exists for automating executions.

## Automate with `RUN`

> All commands for `RUN` must be executable for corresponding linux/container.
> For multiple command, should use string array or repeat `RUN` after previous `RUN`.

```dockerfile
FROM node:alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
RUN apt update && touch ./hello.txt
```

## Set Environment Variables

```dockerfile
FROM node:alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
ENV API_URL=http://api.myapp.com
```

Check variables after rebuilding. There it is.

```bash
/app # echo $API_URL
http://api.myapp.com
/app #
```

## `EXPOSE`

As we launch the server in container, we cannot access it with port specified by node since it's inside the container, so we need `EXPOSE` the map the port for external connection.

```dockerfile
FROM node:alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
ENV API_URL=http://api.myapp.com
EXPOSE 8080
```
