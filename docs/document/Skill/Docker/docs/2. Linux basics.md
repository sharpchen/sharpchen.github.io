## All about file system

In linux world, all files and folders are files.

### Root structure

The root folder represents as `/` which is the top-level directory  in linux.

Start a new bash session, use `ls` to check the structure of root.

``` text
bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib32  lib64  libx32  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
```

| folder | shortcut for |
|----|----|
| bin | binary |
| boot | booting |
| dev | device |
| etc | editable text configuration |
| home | home folder for each user |
| lib | libraries |
| mnt | mounted storages |
| root | home folder for root user only |
| ... | ... |

- If working as root user `cd ~` will direct to `/root/` instead of `/home/`

### Absolute and Relative path

Absolute path starts with `/` which stands for root.
Relative path starts with empty character or `./`, the dot stands for current folder.

### Working with folders

#### checking content under a folder

We use `ls` to represent the members in current path.
By default, its output aligned horizontally, use `ls -1` make it vertically aligned.

```bash
bin
boot
dev
etc
home
lib
lib32
lib64
libx32
media
mnt
opt
proc
root
run
sbin
srv
sys
tmp
usr
var
```

Additionally, use `ls -l` to see more details of those members.

```bash
total 60
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root    7 Oct  4 02:08 bin -> usr/bin
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root 4096 Apr 18  2022 boot
drwxr-xr-x   5 root root  360 Nov  4 12:18 dev
drwxr-xr-x   1 root root 4096 Nov  4 12:23 etc
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root 4096 Apr 18  2022 home
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root    7 Oct  4 02:08 lib -> usr/lib
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root    9 Oct  4 02:08 lib32 -> usr/lib32
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root    9 Oct  4 02:08 lib64 -> usr/lib64
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root   10 Oct  4 02:08 libx32 -> usr/libx32
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root 4096 Oct  4 02:08 media
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root 4096 Oct  4 02:08 mnt
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root 4096 Oct  4 02:08 opt
dr-xr-xr-x 266 root root    0 Nov  4 12:18 proc
drwx------   1 root root 4096 Nov  4 13:53 root
drwxr-xr-x   5 root root 4096 Oct  4 02:12 run
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root    8 Oct  4 02:08 sbin -> usr/sbin
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root 4096 Oct  4 02:08 srv
dr-xr-xr-x  11 root root    0 Nov  4 12:18 sys
drwxrwxrwt   1 root root 4096 Nov  4 12:23 tmp
drwxr-xr-x   1 root root 4096 Oct  4 02:08 usr
drwxr-xr-x   1 root root 4096 Oct  4 02:12 var
```

### Manipulating files and folders

| command | usage |
|----|----|
| `mkdir <path>` | create folder |
| `mv <source_path> <dist_path>` | move or rename |
| `touch <...file_path>` | create file |
| `rm <file_path>` | remove file |
| `rm -r <folder_path>` | recursively remove folder |
| ... | ... |

### Write and Read

#### Read from files

| command | usage |
|----|----|
| `cat <file_path>` | read all text |
| `more <file_path>` | read text with scrolling down |
| `less <file_path>` | read text with scrolling up/down |
| `head -n <line_number> <file_path>` | read first n lines |
| `tail -n <line_number> <file_path>` | recursively remove folder |
| ... | ... |

#### Write to files

Redirect output from command to a file, we use `>` and `>>`. `>` overwrites the file, `>>` appends text to the file.
Any text output can be redirected to a file.
Additionally, use nano or other packages to edit files.

```bash
cat file1.txt > file2.txt
ls -1 / > root_structure.txt
echo hello >> file3.txt
```

### Matching text

Use `grep`(global regular expression print) to text content.

```bash
grep f* <...file_path> # starts with f
grep -i f* <...file_paths> # starts with f/F (case insensitive)
grep hello <...file_paths> # match the text/s
grep hello -r <path> # recursively match
```

### Matching folders and files

| command | usage |
|----|----|
| `ls -a <path>` | list all members including hidden |
| `find <path>` | recursively list all sub folders |
| `find <path> -type d -name "<pattern>"` | recursively find list all folders matching to pattern |
| `find <path> -type f -iname "<pattern>"` | recursively find list all files matching to pattern insensitive |
| `head -n <line_number> <file_path>` | read first n lines |
| `tail -n <line_number> <file_path>` | recursively remove folder |
| ... | ... |

## Command Chaining

### Command sequence

Use `;` to separate multiple command to execute one by one.

```bash
echo start; mkdir test; cd test; echo finished
```

### Command And

Only when previous command are successfully executed, can next command execute? Use `&&`!

```bash
echo start && mkdir test && cd test && echo finished
```

### Command Or

If previous command was executed, next commands won't be executed!
Use `||`!

```bash
mkdir test || echo "test does not exist"
```

### Pipe operator

Pipe args into a command using `|`!

```bash
ls / | head -n 5
```

## Environment Variables

| command | usage |
|----|----|
| `printenv` | print all environment variables |
| `printenv <variable_name>` | print specific variable |
| `echo $<variable_name>` | print specific variable |
| `export <variable_name>=<value>` | add temporary environment variable to current session |
| ... | ... |

### What is .bashrc

The `.bashrc` file in Linux is similar to the `$PROFILE` file in PowerShell on Windows.
Both serve as configuration files that allow users to customize their command-line environment and define various settings and preferences for their shell sessions.
Just like the `.bashrc` file in Linux, the `$PROFILE` file in PowerShell is executed every time a new PowerShell session is initiated.

To reload the `.bashrc` file in the current session,
use `source ~/.bashrc`

## Managing Processes

### Checking running process

Check all process using `ps`.
Ignore the ps process because ps does include itself when retrieving result.

```bash
PID TTY          TIME CMD
    1 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
  285 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
```

### Asynchronous command

The `&` operator allows the command to run asynchronously, enabling you to continue using the terminal for other tasks.
Take a sleep behind the scene!

```bash
root@34aee1a42ba0:/# sleep 100 &
[1] 286 
root@34aee1a42ba0:/# ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
    1 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
  286 pts/0    00:00:00 sleep
  287 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
```

## Managing Users

### Add a user

Use `adduser` to check to options available.

`-m` for example:

`useradd -m byhpbsh`

### Who am I

If you don't know which user you currently logged in, get username using command `whoami`.

```bash
/app # whoami
root
/app #
```

### Check all user info

Check passwords in `/etc/`

```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```

We can see the new user, the `x` means the password is stored somewhere else.
The first `1000` is user id, the latter is group id.

```text
...
www-data:x:33:33:www-data:/var/www:/usr/sbin/nologin
backup:x:34:34:backup:/var/backups:/usr/sbin/nologin
list:x:38:38:Mailing List Manager:/var/list:/usr/sbin/nologin
irc:x:39:39:ircd:/run/ircd:/usr/sbin/nologin
gnats:x:41:41:Gnats Bug-Reporting System (admin):/var/lib/gnats:/usr/sbin/nologin
nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin
_apt:x:100:65534::/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin
byhpbsh:x:1000:1000::/home/byhpbsh:/bin/sh
```

### Specify bash as shell for new user

```bash
usermod -s bash byhpbsh
```

Recheck the `/etc/passwd`

```text
Before:
byhpbsh:x:1000:1000::/home/byhpbsh:/bin/sh
After:
byhpbsh:x:1000:1000::/home/byhpbsh:bash
```

### Starts a new terminal session using docker

- Check running container using `docker ps`.
- Copy the container id
- Run `docker exec -it -u <username> <container_id> bash`
Now we can see the user marked with `$` which indicates a regular user.

```text
byhpbsh@34aee1a42ba0:/$
```

## Managing Groups

### What is Group?

> All users in the same group have the same permissions.

### Add new group

`groupadd <group_name>`

- Let's add a dev group.

```bash
groupadd developers
```

- Then check group info in `/etc/group`

```bash
root@34aee1a42ba0:/# cat /etc/group | grep developers
developers:x:1001:byhpbsh
```

### Add user to group

This  command add a supplementary group for user `byhpbsh`.
A user can have multiple groups, and each user has a primary group named as the username.

```bash
usermod -G developers byhpbsh
```

### Check groups of user

`groups <username>`

```bash
root@34aee1a42ba0:/# groups byhpbsh
byhpbsh : byhpbsh developers
```

## File Permissions

### Permission explained

Let's create a new file `sayHello.sh` in home folder that prints hello when executed.

```bash
root@34aee1a42ba0:/home# echo echo hello > sayHello.sh
```

To check the permissions of files , use `ls -l`

```bash
root@34aee1a42ba0:/home# ls -l
total 8
drwxr-x--- 2 byhpbsh byhpbsh 4096 Nov  5 07:50 byhpbsh    
-rw-r--r-- 1 root    root      11 Nov  5 08:36 sayHello.sh
```

File permissions are represented as 10 characters:

- if starts with `d`, indicating the file is a directory.
- if starts with `-`, indicating the file is a file.
- the rest 9 characters representing 3 permissions for 3 type of users
  - first three for the user who owns the file
  - second for the group owns the file
  - last three for every user
- `r` for readable
- `w` for writable
- `x` for executable
- `-` for none

### Change permission

Currently `sayHello.sh` is not executable for any user.

```text
-rw-r--r-- 1 root    root      11 Nov  5 08:36 sayHello.sh
```

To make it executable for user owns the file, run `chmod u+x <file_path>`, `u` stands for user, `+` stands for add correspond to `-` that revoke the permission.
For other users, run `chmod o+x <file_path>`, for simplicity, `chmod` supports syntax like `chmod o+x+w-r <...files>` to alter permissions in one go.

```bash
root@34aee1a42ba0:/home# chmod u+x sayHello.sh
root@34aee1a42ba0:/home# ls -l
total 8
drwxr-x--- 2 byhpbsh byhpbsh 4096 Nov  5 07:50 byhpbsh    
-rwxr--r-- 1 root    root      11 Nov  5 08:36 sayHello.sh
root@34aee1a42ba0:/home# ./sayHello.sh
hello
```
