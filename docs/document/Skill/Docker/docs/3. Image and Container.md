# Image and Container

## What is the difference

### Image

A image provides all conditions the project needed, including

- A cut-down OS
- Third-party libraries
- Application files
- Environment variables

### Container

- Provides an isolated environment
- Can be stopped & restarted
- Is just a process!

A container is just a  process created from a image, different containers are isolated!

Now let's start new containers to have a test.

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu

root@11c5eb2fa1a2:/# 
```

Then start a new terminal session, run a new container

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu

root@c0735cd1e137:/# 
```

Different containers have different id!
And their file system are isolated.

```bash
root@11c5eb2fa1a2:/# cd ~
root@11c5eb2fa1a2:~# touch test.txt
root@11c5eb2fa1a2:~# ls
test.txt
root@11c5eb2fa1a2:~# 


root@c0735cd1e137:/# cd ~
root@c0735cd1e137:~# ls
root@c0735cd1e137:~# 
# nothing here!
```
