# Start with dockerizing example

## Add a Docker file to your project

A `docker file` is a structural document that includes all requirements for running the project.
We can specify the base image and more arguments to represent a new image just like inheritance.
And base on that `dockerfile`, docker can build a new container, which means dockerfile inherits and acts as a blueprint for container.

## Docker file setup

`Docker Hub` is the registry of docker images, we can ship our images to there and pull images down our machine just like `github`.

- There's some other alternatives like `Azure Container Registry` and `Github Container Registry` and so on.

To specify the image we need, go to a registry and check different distributions. `node` for example.

```dockerfile
# set image distribution
FROM node:alpine
# copy source files to dest dir
COPY . /app
# set working dir for cmd
WORKDIR /app
# command to execute when docker image runs
CMD node app.js
```

## Docker build

After setting dockerfile, run `docker build -t <tag> <where_dockerfile_locate>` in terminal where `dockerfile` locate.
The generated image is not stored in current folder, we don't have to care about where it was stored.
Use `docker images` or `docker image ls` to check existing images on your machine.

```bash
REPOSITORY     TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE
js-dockerize   latest    fcc3e847d662   About a minute ago   187MB
```

## Run docker image

Run docker image using `docker run <image-name>`!
The `CMD` will auto run.

## Pull docker image

`docker pull <image_name>` do the work. And then you can go with your pulled image.
`docker run <image-name>`  can be a shortcut, if image does not exists in local, docker automatically pull from registry.
