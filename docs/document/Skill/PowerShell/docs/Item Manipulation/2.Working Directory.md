# Working Directory

## Change Directory

```ps1
Set-Location <path>
```

Powershell has three builtin aliases for `Set-Location`

```console
$ Get-Alias -Definition 'Set-Location'

CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source
-----------     ----                                               -------    ------
Alias           cd -> Set-Location
Alias           chdir -> Set-Location
Alias           sl -> Set-Location
```

## Current Working Directory

There's two ways to get current working directory in Powershell.

- `$PWD` builtin `PathInfo` variable. Refreshes on each time location changed.
- `Get-Location` cmdlet. Returns a `PathInfo` object.
  - `pwd` is an builtin alias for `Get-Location`.

```ps1
(Get-Location).Path # equivalent to $pwd.Path
```

```console
$ Get-Location | select -Property *

Drive Provider                             ProviderPath       Path
----- --------                             ------------       ----
D     Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem 
```
