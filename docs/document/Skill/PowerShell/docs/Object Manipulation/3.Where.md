# Where

- Filter with custom scriptblock by `-FilterScript`
- Filter by property by `-Property`
- Tons of overloads for binary operators for mimicking direct expression.

> [!NOTE]
> Use `?` or `where` alias for `Where-Object`

## Filter By

- Property

```ps1
# -Property is positional
gci -file | where -Property Exists
```

- Script block

```ps1
# -FilterScript is positional
gci -file | where -FilterScript { $_.CreationTime -gt [DateTime]::Now.AddDays(-5) }
```

## Expression-Like

`Where-Object` contains a lot of parameters to emulate expression-like syntax with `-Property`.

```ps1
gci -file | where Extension -eq '.ps1'
# equivalent to 
gci -file | where { $_.Extension -eq '.ps1' }
```

## Intrinsic Where

Intrinsic `Where` can be useful when performance matters, it provides a way to return early base on certain condition without consuming the whole iteration.

- First or Last items satisfy certain condition
- Skip until one satisfies the condition and return all remaining items(including the one satisfies)
- Return items until one not satisfies the condition(excluding the one satisfies)
- Split items into two collections, one contains items satisfied the condition, the another are items remained.

```cs
Where(scriptblock condition, WhereOperatorSelectionMode mode = 0, int? count)
```
