# Overview

- Integrated with `.NET`
    - Reuse almost any type in `.NET`.
- Dynamic typing
    - Powershell adds extra attribute and properties on dotnet types to enhance experience.
- Case insensitive
    - All language syntax, pattern syntax and even strings are case-insensitive. (There's exception for file system on non-Windows platform)
- Everything is object, more than plain text in shell.
    - Powershell formats the object value as a table if the object is not a primitive type. For primitive types, `Tostring()` will be used instead.
