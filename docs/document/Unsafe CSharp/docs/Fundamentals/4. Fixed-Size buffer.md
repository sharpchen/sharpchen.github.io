# Fixed-Size buffer

## Motivation

Fixed-size buffers are used to declare “C-style” in-line arrays as members of structs, and are primarily useful for interfacing with unmanaged APIs.

## Constraint

- Length of fixed-size buffer may only be constant.
- Fixed-size buffer may only be **declared and accessed** in unsafe context.

```cs
C c = new();
_ = c.Buffer[0]; // CS0214
struct C
{
    public unsafe fixed byte Buffer[30];
    public unsafe void M()
    {
        C c = new();
        _ = c.Buffer[0];
    }
}
```

- **May not be static.** But instance of its containing type can be static.
- Element type must be one of the following: `bool`, `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `char`, `sbyte`, `ushort`, `uint`, `ulong`, `float` or `double`.

```cs

```
