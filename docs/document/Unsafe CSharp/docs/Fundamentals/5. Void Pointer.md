# Void Pointer

`void*` is the loosely typed version of any pointer(like `object` for non pointer types), the underlying type of the original pointer is mopped, so

- Cannot be deferenced.
- Arithmetic can not be performed.

## Pointer comparison

Because an implicit conversion exists from any pointer type to the void* type, operands of any pointer type can be compared using these operators. The comparison operators compare the addresses given by the two operands as if they were unsigned integers.

```cs
bool operator ==(void* x, void* y);
bool operator !=(void* x, void* y);
bool operator <(void* x, void* y);
bool operator >(void* x, void* y);
bool operator <=(void* x, void* y);
bool operator >=(void* x, void* y);
```
