# Flake Structure

The content of a flake file is a attribute set which usually contains three basic attributes:

- `description` a string describes the usage of the flake file.
- `inputs` all dependencies needed and structured as a whole set.
- `outputs` a function that uses inputs as argument when called to generate the config.
