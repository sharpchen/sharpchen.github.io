# Task Cancellation

## What Manage it & What Represents it

Two essential types for cancellation are

- `CancellationToken`: a **readonly struct** represents a state of cancellation of a task, it's the only property of its containing class.
    - `CancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested`: represents the whether cancellation is decided from the source.
    - a token cannot be reused after cancellation
    - all tokens from a same source are identical
        ```cs
        // checks backing source only
        public bool Equals(CancellationToken other) => _source == other._source;
        ```
- `CancellationTokenSource` itself is responsible for triggering the cancellation, serve as a control center for all tokens generated from it.
    - `CancellationTokenSource.Token` is a property of type `CancellationToken`, such design allows controlling multiple tokens by single source since token is a readonly struct
    - inform all containing task of any token generated from source to cancel on `Cancel` or `CancelAfter` or `CancelAsync`
    - `IDisposable` as well would be disposed after cancellation
- `OperationCanceledException`: to terminate a task from inside with a Cancelled status.
    - such exception can be catched on wait to handle after cancellation

`OperationCanceledException` is a special exception type dedicated for terminating task.
Compiler recognizes it as special case so it doesn't break the whole program but only terminate the task.

```cs
var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
var token = cts.Token;
Task task = new(() => {
    while (true) {
        if (token.IsCancellationRequested) {
            throw new OperationCanceledException(token); // does not terminate the whole program // [!code highlight] 
        }
        Console.WriteLine("working with task");
    }
});

task.Start();

cts.Cancel(); // token.IsCancellationRequested changed // [!code highlight] 
```

A better practice is using `token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` as a shorthand.

```cs
token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested(); // no if statement needed here // [!code highlight] 
Console.WriteLine("working with task");
```

## CancellationToken as Parameter

Aforementioned examples capture `token` by closure so you can access it inside the task.

What you would find confusing is, task creation methods like `new Task`, `Task.Run`, `Task.Factory.StartNew` all supports a parameter of type `CancellationToken`.(you may set it as parameter in a async method as well)

What is the purpose for passing (a copy of) the token manually even when we still need to cpature it by closure?

Status of a task is partly dependent on the token passed as parameter, a task can only be in a Canceled status **when all of the following were satisfied**
- `OperationCanceledException`(or its derived exception type) is thrown
- `token.IsCancellationRequested` is true
- `token` in closure passed to `OperationCanceledException` equals `token` as parameter

So this checking on whether cancellation suceeded requires a validation on the token which must be passed as parameter, so that the hidden mechanism inside task can examine.

<!--TODO: add example-->

```cs
using CancellationTokenSource cts = new(5000);
CancellationToken token = cts.Token;

Task task = Task.Factory.StartNew(() => {
    while (true) {
        Console.WriteLine("operation...");
        token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
        Thread.Sleep(1000);
    }
}, cts.Token); // it's oke, all tokens from same source are identical

try {
    task.Wait();
} catch (AggregateException) {
    Console.WriteLine(task.Status); // Canceled
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Pass `CancellationToken.None` to represent task is not cancelable.

## On Cancellation

You can register callbacks to be triggered when a token is requested to cancel.
Callbacks would be triggered before the task is truly terminated.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The callbacks registered runs synchronously, `CancellationTokenSource.Cancel` does not finish until all callbacks are finished.

```cs
token.Register(() => { // [!code highlight] 
    Console.WriteLine("callback triggered"); // [!code highlight] 
}); // [!code highlight] 

Task<int> task = new(() => {
    while (true) {
        token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
        Console.WriteLine("continuing the task");
    }
});

task.Start();
cts.Cancel();
Console.WriteLine("task finished");
// callback triggered // [!code highlight] 
// task finished
```

Besides `token.Register`, token itself can wait by blocking another thread created by a new task to achieve the same.

```cs
Task<int> task = new(() => {
    while (true) {
        token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
        Console.WriteLine("continuing the task");
    }
});

Task.Run(() => {
    token.WaitHandle.WaitOne(); // wait until the token received any signal // [!code highlight] 
    Console.WriteLine("callback triggerd from another task");
});

task.Start();
cts.Cancel();
Console.WriteLine("task finished");
```

### After Cancellation

After cancellation simply means chaining a event after previous task, and allowing access to previous task in the callback so you can do things conditionally.

<!--TODO: faulted example is not right, the task is not canceled correctly-->

```cs
var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
var token = cts.Token;
Task<int> task = new(() => {
    while (true) {
        token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
        Console.WriteLine("continuing the task");
    }
});

task.ContinueWith(prev => { // [!code highlight] 
    if (prev.Status is TaskStatus.Faulted) { // [!code highlight]
        Console.WriteLine("cancelled"); // [!code highlight] 
    } // [!code highlight] 
}); // [!code highlight] 

task.Start();
cts.Cancel();
Console.WriteLine("task finished");
```

## Combined Tokens

<!--TODO: finish this part -->

You may wanted to combine tokens from different sources to perform a simultaneous cancellation even they're from different sources.

## Common Practice

```cs
using (CancellationTokenSource cts = new(timeout)) {
    try {
        await task(foo, cts.Token);
    } catch (OperationCanceledException) {
        Console.WriteLine("canceled");
    }
}
```
