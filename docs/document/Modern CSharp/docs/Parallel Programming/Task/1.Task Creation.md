# Task Creation

## Create & Start

Task can be created from the following sources:

- constructors of `Task` and `Task<T>`
- Task creation methods like `Task.Run` and `TaskFactory.StartNew`
- `async` delegates

```cs
var task = new Task(() => Console.WriteLine("hello"));
task.Start(); // runs on another thread asynchronously
```

> [!NOTE]
> Other utils like `Task.Delay` does create task but more specific so they're not been discussed here.

To start a job there's multiple approaches to do the same:

- `task.Start`: a instance method to start the task
- `Task.Factory.StartNew`: create and start at one go
- `Task.Run`: create and start at one go but does not support any argument
- Start from any `async` method: automatically started on invocation.

```cs
_ = Task.Factory.StartNew(() => Console.WriteLine("hello"));
_ = Task.Run(() => Console.WriteLine("hello"));

var fooAsync = async () => {
    await Task.Run(() => Console.WriteLine("foo"));
};

fooAsync(); // started automatically
```

> [!NOTE]
> Continued tasks created by `ContinueWith` cannot `Start()`

### Create Task with Return

Generic tasks come into play when provided with delegate would return a result.
The type parameter is exactly the type of return.

```cs
Task<int> task = new Task<int>(() => 123);
task.Start();
```

### Create with Argument

Both `TaskFactory` and `Task` supports an overload to accept **single argument** when the signature contains a parameter.

Since only single value is supported, you may need an abstraction when to pass multiple values

```cs
_ = Task.Factory.StartNew((object foo) => {
    Console.WriteLine(foo.GetType());
}, 123);

var task = new Task((object foo) => Console.WriteLine(foo.GetType()), 123); // [!code highlight] 
task.Start();
```

> [!NOTE]
> `Task.Run` does not support overloads accept an argument

> [!TIP]
> One should prefer creating tasks supports arguments using `async` delegate unless you don't want it to begin immediately.

### Create from Async Delegate

`async` is a syntax sugar for creating task from a lambda or `async` method.
Each `async` delegate is like a factory for it's dedicated action only.

```cs
Func<Task> foo = async () => {
    await Task.Delay(100);
};

await foo();

Func<int, Task<int>> bar = async (int number) => {
    await Task.Delay(1000);
    return number;
};

bar(123).Wait();
```

And it can be super useful when creating a batch of tasks using LINQ:

```cs
_ = await Task.WhenAll(Enumerable.Range(1, 10).Select(async x => {
    await Task.Delay(100);
    return x;
}));
```

#### Unwrap

If one need to start a `async` delegate directly using `TaskFactory.StartNew`, `TaskExtension.Unwrap()` is required to get it work as expected.

That is because, `async` delegate is a factory for dedicated task, so the result for starting the delegate directly would be a task created from the delegate instead of the expected result.

```cs
// note: it's a wrapped task
Task<Task<int>> t = Task.Factory.StartNew(async () => {
    await Task.Delay(1000);
    return 42;
});

// use this instead!!
Task<int> t2 = Task.Factory.StartNew(async () => {
    await Task.Delay(1000);
    return 42;
}).Unwrap();

// functionally you can use await to unwrap but it's definitely not recommended
Task<int> t2 = await Task.Factory.StartNew(async () => {
    await Task.Delay(1000);
    return 42;
});

```

> [!TIP]
> `Task.Run` has a implicit auto-unwrap for some of its overloads, you may prefer this over `TaskFactory.StartNew` to start a simple task.
>```cs
>// The type is unwraped
>Task<int> t = Task.Run(async () => {
>    await Task.Delay(1000);
>    return 42;
>});
>```

### Create from Value

Sometimes you may want to wrap a already available value within a task just to satisfy the type checking.
This is called pre-completed task, can be done by `Task.FromResult`
Such task does not start a new thread and never needed to be awaited.

```cs
Task<int> task = Task.FromResult(42);
Console.WriteLine(task.Result); // Outputs: 42
```

### Create as Continued Task

`Task.ContinueWith` creates a task after the previous task has terminated with certain condition, and it starts simultaneously.
Such condition can be specified by `TaskContinuationOptions` in its overloads.

```cs
Task.Run(async () => {
    await Task.Delay(100);
}).ContinueWith(prev => {
    Console.WriteLine("Continued task started automatically!");
}).Wait();
```

#### Continue When

```cs
var task1 = Task.Run(() => {
    Thread.Sleep(1000);
});

var task2 = Task.Run(() => {
    Thread.Sleep(1000);
});

await Task.Factory.ContinueWhenAny([task1, task2], prev => {
    Console.WriteLine($"Tasks {prev.Id} completed.");
});

await Task.Factory.ContinueWhenAll([task1, task2], prev => {
    Console.WriteLine($"Tasks {string.Join(", ", prev.Select(x => x.Id))} completed.");
});
```

#### Continue When with Results

```cs
var task1 = Task.Run(() => {
    return 123;
});

var task2 = Task.FromResult(456);

await Task.Factory.ContinueWhenAny([task1, task2], prev => {
    Console.WriteLine($"Tasks {prev.Id} completed.");
    Console.WriteLine($"Result: {prev.Result}");
});

await Task.Factory.ContinueWhenAll([task1, task2], prev => {
    Console.WriteLine($"Tasks {string.Join(", ", prev.Select(x => x.Id))} completed.");
    Console.WriteLine($"Result: {string.Join(", ", prev.Select(x => x.Result))}");
});
```

### `Task.Run` vs `TaskFactory.StartNew`

- `Task.Run`
    - starts with default `TaskCreationOptions.DenyChildAttach` which prevents child tasks, and there's no way to use other option.
    - recommended for Compute-Bound task
    - no overload for passing argument to task
    - uses default scheduler and can not be changed
    - does not require unwrap to run a `async` delegate

- `TaskFactory.StartNew`
    - can do everything `Task.Run` can do(allow child tasks)
    - can have more control on `TaskCreationOptions` and scheduler
    - require unwrap for `async` delegate

> [!NOTE]
> A compute-bound task is a task that primarily uses the CPU for calculations rather than waiting on external resources like disk I/O, network requests, or database queries. 
> These tasks typically involve intensive computations and benefit from parallelism using multiple CPU cores.

```cs
_ = Task.Run(() => { });

// equivalent to

_ = Task.Factory.StartNew(
    () => { },
    CancellationToken.None,
    TaskCreationOptions.DenyChildAttach,
    TaskScheduler.Default
);
```

## Creation Options

<!--TODO: creation options-->

## Sleeping on Thread

- `Thread.Sleep`: pauses the thread and allows the scheduler to run another thread while sleeping, for the efficiency.
- `SpinWait.SpinUntil`: pauses the thread until a condition fits. The scheduler are not allowed to run another thread using current resource of this thread.
    ```cs
    Task task = new(() => {
        SpinWait.SpinUntil(() => {
            return true;
        }, 1000);
    });
    ```

- Aforementioned `token.WaitHandle.WaitOne` to work together with a cancellation token.
