# Wait for Task

## Blocking & Non-Blocking Wait

Waiting a task means the execution of code is synchronous but there's a essential difference between Blocking Wait & Non-Blocking Wait

- accessing for `task.Result` causing the blocking wait that blocks the main thread
    ```cs
    Task<int> task = new(() => 123);

    task.Start();

    Console.WriteLine(task.Result); // compiler knows it should wait the task blockingly // [!code highlight] 
    // 123
    ```
- `await` operator waits the task without blocking the calling thread.
    ```cs
    int foo = await Foo(); // does not block the main thread but still synchronous
    static async Task<int> Foo {
        await Task.Delay(500);
        return 123;
    }
    ```

- `task.Wait`: to wait the task itself.
- `Task.Wait*`: utils to wait a batch of tasks in a **blocking** manner.
- `Task.When*`: utils to wait a batch of tasks in a **non-blocking** manner.


A task must be started before awaiting, or the thread would be blocked forever.
A task from `async` method is started implicitly so no worry here.

To wait a task synchronously, use `await` operator before a started task object.

```cs
var task = new Task(() => Console.WriteLine("hello"));
task.Start(); // must get it started!!! // [!code highlight] 
await task;
```

Starting a simple task manually is quiet trivial so one should prefer `Task.Run` or `Task.Factory.StartNew`

```cs
await Task.Factory.StartNew((object? foo) => {
    Console.WriteLine(((dynamic)foo).Foo);
}, new { Foo = 345 });

await Task.Run(() => { Console.WriteLine("hello"); });
```

## `WhenAll` vs `WhenAny`

- `WhenAll` waits until all tasks were completed, returns all results in the order of tasks as an array.
- `WhenAny` waits until one task was completed, returns the task completed first.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `WhenAll` and `WhenAny` do not start tasks for you, make sure they're started before waiting.

```cs
IEnumerable<Task<int>> tasks = Enumerable.Range(1, 10).Select(async x => {
    await Task.Delay(x * 100);
    return x;
});

int[] results = await Task.WhenAll(tasks); // 1, 2, 3 ... 10
Task<int> first = await Task.WhenAny(tasks);
Console.WriteLine(first.Result); // should be 1
```

### Practical Usage

`WhenAny` can be used as a simple countdown with `Task.Delay`

```cs
using CancellationTokenSource cts = new();
var token = cts.Token;
Task task = new Task(() => {
    int i = Random.Shared.Next(1, 5); // random countdown // [!code highlight] 
    while (i-- > 0) {
        token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
        Console.WriteLine("operation...");
        Thread.Sleep(1000);
    }
}, token);

try {
    task.Start(); // [!code highlight] 
    if (task == await Task.WhenAny(task, Task.Delay(3000))) { // to race with the delay // [!code highlight]
        Console.WriteLine("Task succeeded");
    } else {
        cts.Cancel();
        Console.WriteLine("Task canceled for timeout");
    }
} catch (OperationCanceledException) { }
```
